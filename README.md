# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning (Regression)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using machine learning
regression techniques. The goal is to understand how different features such as
property characteristics and location-related factors influence house prices
and to build a model that can estimate prices accurately.

The project follows an end-to-end **regression workflow**, including data
exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify important features affecting house prices
- Build a regression model to predict house prices
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics
- Draw business-relevant conclusions from the results

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information related to residential properties, including:
- Property size and features
- Location-related attributes
- Price (target variable)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checked data distribution and missing values
- Analyzed feature relationships with price
- Used visualizations to understand trends and outliers
- Identified relevant features for model training

## 🤖 Model Used
- Linear Regression

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The regression model was evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### 🔑 Key Observations
- Certain features have a strong influence on house prices
- The model is able to capture linear relationships effectively
- Performance metrics indicate reasonable prediction accuracy
- Feature selection plays an important role in improving results

## 📁 Project Files
- `Ml Project.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing EDA, preprocessing,
  model training, and evaluation

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical understanding of **regression-based
machine learning**. It showcases the ability to analyze numerical data,
build predictive models, evaluate results, and interpret outcomes.
The project is suitable for **Data Analyst / Data Scientist fresher roles**
and provides a strong foundation for more advanced regression techniques.
